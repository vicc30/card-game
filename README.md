# PROJECT: MEMORY CARD

This project is my solution for the project Memory Card. This project is part of [Odin Project js Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/).

## Instructions.

- [x] Create a new project using create-react-app.

- [x] Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score.

  * Scoreboard is included in component `/src/components/Header.js`. It receive state score as props from `App.js` and render it. It is named as `score`

- [x] Should include “Best Score”, which shows the best score you achieved thus far.

  * Best score is included in component `/src/components/Header.js`. It receive state score as props from `App.js` and render it. It is named as `maxScore`
  
- [x] You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text.

  * Cards are saved as array with image path, name, alt and id in `/src/components/Cards.js`

- [x] There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one.

  - All the logic is in `/src/App.js`

- [x] Set up Folder structure.

- [ ] Style Application.

  - Style are saved on folder `/src/styles`
